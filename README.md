# AA Basic Shortcodes Plugin Boilerplate

A standardized, organized, modular foundation for building simple & basic shortcodes in form of a WordPress Plugins.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `ChangeLog.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `aa_basic_shortcodes` subdirectory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/inline-documentation-standards/php-documentation-standards/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
* The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed in one of two ways both of which are documented below. Note that because of its directory structure, the Boilerplate cannot be installed “as-is.”

Instead, the options are:

### Copying a Directory

1. Copy the `aa_basic_shortcodes` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory. You may wish to rename this to something else.
2. In the WordPress dashboard, navigation to the *Plugins* page
Locate the menu item that reads “The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate.”
3. Click on *Activate.*
